        <h2>Welcome</h2>
        <p>Technology and innovation is the beating heart of Avanti. In 2010 Avanti were the first British company to launch a Ka-band satellite, HYLAS 1, and the first satellite operator to provide Ka-band services across the UK and Europe. Today, we own and operate a fleet of five high-throughput satellites covering EMEA and a fully resilient and secure extensive ground network.
        Our steerable beams, available on HYLAS 2, HYLAS 3 and HYLAS 4, provide immediate and secure ka-band capacity wherever you may need it across Africa, the Middle East, Europe and the Americas..</p>

        <p>Launched in August 2019, HYLAS 3 is a steerable cluster of 8 beams that can be steered to anywhere within the 31˚ E coverage zone, providing flexible and high throughput connectivity across EMA and part of Asia. It also has a unique independently steerable gateway beam allowing for flexible gateway locations.</p>

        <h2>Our Team</h2>
        <p>The gain of a dish antenna is proportional to the frequency being used. At the high frequencies of Ka-band, you can use a smaller dish to get an equivalent power output up to the satellite. It also means the RF amplifier requirements are reduced.HTS Ka-band beams are much more focused, resulting in high powered spot beams lit over specific regions. Much higher throughput can be achieved using the same amount of bandwidth, driving down the cost of the spectrum and the cost per bit. Ka-band spot beams often have 10 times more capacity than traditional Ku-band satellites.</p>

        <p>Avanti’s open architecture is well adapted to serve customers with highly customised service needs and stringent requirements in terms of availability and guaranteed data rates, allowing them to choose their preferred and / or existing ground equipment.Ka-band technology opens up the market to a new range of frequencies that is more cost-effective than other bands providing higher quality, better performance and higher speed services.</p>

        <h2>Services</h2>
        <p>Working with the Ministry of Interior and Red Cross Society in Kenya, Avanti and its partners are undertaking a Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR) programme, which uses satellite technology to improve Kenyan capacity to plan for and respond to disasters effectively.Avanti’s satellite systems provide a secure, resilient, always-on infrastructure in disaster situations – providing critical tools for emergency communications and situation assessment. We were able to move one of our beams over Mozambique to provide vital connectivity for rescuers when Cyclone Idai hit the country in March 2019. At Avanti, we strive to constantly innovate and leverage our satellite technology to empower people, strengthen communities and give back to the regions we work. From educating over 300,000 children in Africa to delivering connectivity to refugee camps, we provide vital connectivity when and where it is needed most.</p>

        <p>We have a fully authorised, resilient and secure ground network comprising of 7 earth stations strategically located across EMEA, an international fibre ring and a cross-connected fibre network.Our diverse owned gateways ensure ultra-reliability. The multiple backhaul circuits from each ground station provide additional resilience and redundancy. Cross-connect network creates resilience and redundancy in case of loss or damage to any link ensuring our customers remain connected.</p>
